                            Z DAY ZERO is a fictional horror zombie first-person shooter game created as part of my project work.
                            <br>
                            This project was divided into three key phases:
                            <br>
                            1. Logo Creation – Designing the official branding for Z DAY ZERO.
                            <br>
                            2. Promotional Website – Developing a website to market the game as an upcoming release, allowing potential players to pre-order.
                            <br>
                            3. Z DAY ZERO APP – Creating the ultimate companion app to help players navigate the game's chaotic world. Whether you're a seasoned survivor or a new recruit, the app enhances the gaming experience and keeps players connected with the Z DAY ZERO community.
                       </p>  
                   </div>             
               </div> 
                <h1 class="section-title topmarg">Logo Creation</h1>
                <div class="project-detail">
                    <p>
                        Starting with the Logo concept, I want to present the logo's typography in a bold, distressed way to convey the harsh, survivalist theme of the game and as for the imagery elements, I played around with graphics that symbolizes the onset of the outbreak, hence I started sketching various logo designs that represent things such as a zombie's hand, a skull, the typical zombie bio-hazard sign, even weapons such as a gun or something melee-related to capture the user's attention and to grasp the strong identity of the game.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div class="ZDZLogoDrawings">

                </div>
                <div class="project-detail">
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, 1 logo stood out the most that I felt has the most potential for a digital rendition and that is the very first zombie-hand that I drew
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <embed src="images/ZDAYZERO/LogoToDigital.png" width="800px">

                <div class="project-detail">
                    <p>
                        This logo was decided on because I felt that the chopped-off zombie's hand has all the information and detail needed to immediately know what the game "Z DAY ZERO" is about. Upon first glance, it should be known to players that the game is of the horror genre and is regarding zombies.
                        <br>
                        As for the font choice, the Edo SZ font was choses as I love how the font looks with the brush-like writing style, it gives off the feeling of the font is being written with blood which fits the game's theme perfectly. As for the sub logo, I played around with the spacing sizing of each individual letter to create a jammed/claustrophobic feeling to give off the aggressive touch.

                    <p>
                       For the promotional website, I started doing my research and to gather various moodboard ideas for inspiration and reference, after I found a few potential designs that caught my eye, I drew and sketch out the wireframe layout I wanted for my promotional website on paper.

                        <p>
                            For the layout design, firstly I want the promotional website to start with a eye-ctaching landing page consisting of the countdown timer to the game's official release.<br>
                            <br>
                            After catching the user’s attention with the
                            countdown to game’s release, present them
                            with the game’s official game trailer and
                            some brief information of the game
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After watching the game trailer, show the
                            recommended PC Specs for the user as at
                            this point, we have already caught the
                            user’s attention to the game
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After knowing the PC Specs, intrigue the
                            user more by letting them interact with the
                            website to know more about the types of
                            zombies presented in the game
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After the user is under good impression of
                            the game, at this point we will suggest they
                            make a purchase of the game and show the
                            available platforms and prices of the game 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Finally, end off the website with available
                            merchandise to go with the purchase of the
                            game
                        </p>
                    </div>

                <div class="project-detail">
                    <p>
                        Last but not least, I added the color scheme and design in and this is how the final design for the promotional website looked!
