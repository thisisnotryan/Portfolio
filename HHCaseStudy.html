                            High Hopes is an Endless Rogue-like Jumper game fully designed and coded with unity by my team LiteWorks. A brief synopsis of the game is that your dog has been taken away by God, and your only choice to save your dog is to jump!. The core gameplay features includes "Obtaining the highest score possible, collecting milestone upgrades to aid your traversal, avoiding obstacles, and to collect power-ups to boost your score. Our team strives to achieve a game that is simple as we firmly believe in the phrase "Less is more" and we absolutely do not want to overscope for our project, hence we rather focus on the replay value of the game and to make use of the competetive spirit of gamers as they strive to be in the top leaderboards of the game and compete against their friends.
                            <br>
                            In this case study, I will be going through the entire journey of my team and showing the phases that we went through starting from the planning to the end product.

                        After reading the brief, my team LiteWorks immediately got together to discuss what are the possible game ideas we would like to do and after mutual agreements, we ended up with the idea of working on an Endless Rogue-like Jumper game, heavily inspiried by games such as Jump King, as we want to deter from the typical platforming games that a lot of other teams are doing. Hence we wanted to attempt something different in hopes that it would stand out.
                        <br>
                        The first couple weeks were used for planning and designing the basic level concept, map design concept, character &amp; environment concept and basic User Interface concept.

                        <br>
                        Below are some of the early concept ideas and sketches done by our team.

                        Throughout these projects, I gained several key takeaways that have greatly influenced my approach to design and development.
                        <br>
                        Firstly, I realized that having a solid understanding of a project beforehand significantly speeds up the workflow and reduces the workload. Taking the time to conduct proper research, gather references, and create mood boards is an essential step that should never be overlooked.
                        <br>
                        Secondly, I learned the importance of investing time and effort into initial sketches and wireframes. Iterating at this stage is much easier and more efficient compared to making major changes later in the process.
                        <br>
                        Lastly, although I managed to complete and submit all my projects on time, there were moments when I felt rushed. It made me wonderâ€”if I had started earlier, would my work have been even better? This experience reinforced the importance of early planning and time management to ensure a smoother process and higher-quality results.
