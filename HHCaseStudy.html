                            High Hopes is an Endless Rogue-like Jumper game fully designed and coded with unity by my team LiteWorks. A brief synopsis of the game is that your dog has been taken away by God, and your only choice to save your dog is to jump!. The core gameplay features includes "Obtaining the highest score possible, collecting milestone upgrades to aid your traversal, avoiding obstacles, and to collect power-ups to boost your score. Our team strives to achieve a game that is simple as we firmly believe in the phrase "Less is more" and we absolutely do not want to overscope for our project, hence we rather focus on the replay value of the game and to make use of the competetive spirit of gamers as they strive to be in the top leaderboards of the game and compete against their friends.
                            <br>
                            In this case study, I will be going through the entire journey of my team and showing the phases that we went through starting from the planning to the end product.

                    <p>
                        After reading the brief, my team LiteWorks immediately got together to discuss what are the possible game ideas we would like to do and after mutual agreements, we ended up with the idea of working on an Endless Rogue-like Jumper game, heavily inspiried by games such as Jump King, as we want to deter from the typical platforming games that a lot of other teams are doing. Hence we wanted to attempt something different in hopes that it would stand out.
                        <br>
                        The first couple weeks were used for planning and designing the basic level concept, map design concept, character &amp; environment concept and basic User Interface concept. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Below are some of the early concept ideas and sketches done by our team.

                                        <p>Here are some of our initial character conceptualizing ideas and rough sketches of our character "Magnus". The idea of the character's style is simple and minimalistic as we would like the gameplay to be the main focus and not some fancy character.</p>

                                        <p>For the environment concept, similar to the character, we decided to go for a simple style and decided that the character should jump on the rooftop of buildings from one to another. Different color scheme for the buildings are also representive of the different levels, this is for players to know that they have advanced to the next level which is increased difficulty.</p>

                        As this was one of the first major group projects that required us to collaborate with people outside of our program, I gained a lot of valuable first-hand experience.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This was the first time my course worked alongside students from the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art and Animation. Forming a team with people we didn’t know from the BFA course was a new and slightly intimidating experience. Breaking the ice and building rapport was a challenge — let alone working together effectively.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Fortunately, my group, Lite Works, warmed up to each other quickly. We agreed on an idea early on and got to work as soon as possible. Everything went quite smoothly overall. Of course, there were some ups and downs along the way, but for our first major group project, I’m extremely proud of what our team achieved.
